# marcov-tree
python code for calculating the Marcov triplets organized in the marcov tree
marcov-tree
A numerical mathematical software that calculates the Marcov numbers as triplets and assigns it to a node in the binary marcov tree structure.
Installation

!pip install anytree
!pip install graphviz
!apt-get install python-numpy python-qt4 python-lxml python-six
Usage
The input to the code is the number of tree levels to be calculated. The Marcov numbers are stored as triplets and assigned to a node in the binary marcov tree structure. The Marcov tree can be visualized using the RenderTree and DotExporter functions from the anytree library.
Example
When calculating the marcov tree up to n=3  level, the code yields the following result:
